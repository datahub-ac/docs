# Create an instance

![](../.gitbook/assets/info_simple.svg.png)**Before creating a new instance**, make sure that the right permissions are available. Only space administrators are allowed to create new instances in their space. Please contact a space administrator to create a new instance with appropriate _editor_ or _viewer_ privileges.

![](../.gitbook/assets/info_simple.svg.png)**Upon successful creation** **of a single-user or a group-user instance**, the browser will be redirected to view the newly created instance.

## **There are two options to create an instance:**

## **Creating instance\(s\) from a snapshot**

In many cases, the space administrator might want to create one or more instances that are based on a specified snapshotted state. This option might be preferred by many as it saves time if the intention is to create instances having the contents of a specific snapshot. The following steps need to be carried out:

1. Navigate to the instance view where the snapshots of an instance are listed. This can be done by clicking on level 3 \(Instance\) from the side bar. 
2. A snapshot needs to be selected from the list of snapshot that will serve as basis for the newly created instance. 
3. A blue alert message will appear in the top and it will contain a button named **CREATE INSTANCE.** Click on that button. 
4. Choose the type of instance that is to be created  


   * **Separate instance for each user**: this option requires a list of emails and a single new instance will be created for each email address. The owner of each email address will receive an invitation to join the space and work with their own instance. This option would be preferred when a professor wants to invite multiple students to join a class.



   * **Joint instance for multiple users**: this option requires a list of emails and only one single instance will be created and shared by all users whose emails were provided. This option also requires a name and description for the new instance. Joint instances are designed to facilitate group work: group assignments, or small group research activities are best carried out in joint instances. 



   * **Single instance**: with this option, a single instance will be created for the current space administrator. An instance name and description needs to be provided to complete the operation.

  

5. Provide the information required by each field. 
6. Click on the **Add Instance** button.

## **Creating empty instance\(s\)**

To create one or more empty instances, please follow the steps below:

1. Navigate to the space view where the list of instances are visible within a space. This can be done by clicking on level 2 \(Space\) from the side bar. 
2. From the side bar on the right click on **Add New Instance.** 
3. Choose the type of instance that needs to be created: 
   * **Separate instance for each user**: this option requires a list of emails and a single new instance will be created for each email address. The owner of each email address will receive an invitation to join the space and work with their own instance. This option would be preferred when a professor wants to invite multiple students to join a class. 
   * **Joint instance for multiple users**: this option requires a list of emails and only one single instance will be created and shared by all users whose emails were provided. This option also requires a name and description for the new instance. Joint instances are designed to facilitate group work: group assignments, or small group research activities are best carried out in joint instances.  
   * **Single instance**: with this option, a single instance will be created for the current space administrator. An instance name and description needs to be provided to complete the operation. 
4. Click on the **Add Instance** button.
