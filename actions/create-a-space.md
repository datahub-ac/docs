# Create a space

\*\*\*\*![](../.gitbook/assets/info_simple.svg.png)**Before creating a space,** make sure that the right permissions are set. Only organization managers and faculty members are allowed to create new spaces. A faculty member or organization manager needs to be contacted in order for a new space to be set up.  

![](../.gitbook/assets/info_simple.svg.png)**Upon successful space creation**, the web browser will be redirected to the view of the newly created space.  

## To create a new space

 1- Navigate to the main page where the list of spaces of the organization is visible. This can be done by selecting the organization you want to work in from the dashboard. The dashboard is the first view that you will see once you log in to DataHub. If you are not in the dashboard view, then you reach it from the main sidebar via the three-lines-shaped button on the top-left.

3- Provide a name and a description of the new space in the respective fields.  


4- Click on the **Add Space** button
