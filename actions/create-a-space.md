# Create a space

* Before creating a new space, make sure that the right permissions are set. Only organization managers and faculty members are allowed to create new spaces. A faculty member or organization manager needs to be contacted in order for a new space to be set up.
* Upon successfully creating a space, the web browser will be redirected to the view of the newly created space.

#### To create a new space:

1.  Navigate to the main page where the list of spaces of the organization is visible. This can be done by clicking on level 1 \(Organization\) from the side bar. 
2. From the side bar on the left click on **Add New Space.** 
3. Provide a name and a description of the new space in the respective fields. 
4. Click on the **Add Space** button



#### If you are encountering a problem creating a space, refer to the troubleshooting guide [here](../troubleshooting/authorization-issues/cannot-create-a-space.md).
