# Create an application

* Before creating a new application, that the right permissions are set up. Only _instance editors_ are allowed to create new applications in their instances. Please contact a space administrator or an instance editor to make sure that the right permissions are set up. 
* Upon successful completion of the operation, the browser will be redirected to the application list view where the newly created application is visible and available for work.

### **To create a new application:**

1. Navigate to the instance view where the current state and the list of snapshots in an instance are visible. This can be done by clicking on level 3 \(Instance\) from the side bar, or by selecting the instance from the space view. 
2. Click on the **OPEN** **CURRENT STATE** button. 
3. From the side bar on the left, select **Add New Application**. 
4. First select the application to create \(e.g. JupyterLab + Latex\). 
5. Provide a name and a description of the new application. 
6. Click on the **Add Application** button.
