# Getting started with a class

## **To get started with a class, here are the steps to follow:**

## 1- **Accept invitation.**

Access to a class is by invitation only. Prospective participants receive the invite by email from the class instructor. To accept, click on the **Review** **Invitation** button.

### ![](../.gitbook/assets/info_simple.svg.png)**In case you haven't received an invitation email, please check the troubleshooting documentation available** [**here**](../troubleshooting/login-issues/i-havent-received-an-invitation-email.md)**.**

Several options are currently available to accept the invitation. Members of a Swiss academic institution \(e.g. University of Lugano\), shall choose the “**I have a Swiss University account**” option. Sign in with your institution credentials. Contingent on successful authentication, the invitation is confirmed and automatically singed into DataHub.

## 2- Locate and start/open your application

Once logged in to DataHub, the first page you will is the Dashboard which displays which [organizations](../data-organization/organizations.md) you are member of, and the most recent applications that were created and used.  
  
While in the dashboard, if you want to open an application and start working with it, then first locate the application under **Quick Access Applications,** then from the right side click on **START APPLICATION.** This will start your application and will take you to the view where you can start working with the application. If you have already started the application, then instead of **START APPLICATION**, the button will be called **OPEN APPLICATION**. In the screenshot below, the user has one RStudio application. ****

## ​3- Open and work with files from the application.

When you open an application, you will have already your files and folder ready to be used. For example, suppose you are working with an RStudio application and you have an R code inside a folder called **week\_01**.  Inside the application, you will see your folder under the **FILES** tab on the right. If you click on the folder, then you will be able to see the contents of it which will include the R code you are looking for. Clicking on the R file, you will be able to see and work with it in the R console.
